# Time and Date
Wednesday, November 5, 2025 11:15am - 12:30pm (CET) in room 0.11+0.12 during [IEEE VIS](https://ieeevis.org/year/2025/info/program/panels#talk-try-tell-challenges-and-opportunities-for-theory-grounded-data-visualization-in-extended-reality)

# Motivation 
2D visualization frameworks are screen bound and do not provide extensive human-data interaction modes, which XR can offer. 3D systems and environments open up the possibilities of intuitive interaction with three-dimensional data representations - to interpret and use those as effectively as established, mature 2D visualization tools, new supporting frameworks are needed.

# Abstract 
Numerous formalizations have emerged for creating, interpreting, and teaching data visualizations. The past decade has witnessed significant advances in visualization paradigms beyond keyboard and mouse, like immersive analytics. Mature visualization ecosystems are established for screen-based technologies; however, no counterparts have emerged yet in the immersive visualization domain. Consistent implementations are limited due to scattered tools and platforms, while theoretical frameworks require extension to extended reality (XR).

**“TALK, TRY, TELL: Challenges and Opportunities for Theory-Grounded Data Visualization in Extended Reality”** addresses these gaps through an innovative "TALK, TRY, TELL" format that combines theoretical discourse with hands-on experience. Expert speakers present their own research on theory and practice and examine how established principles translate to immersive environments, representing a diverse and balanced spectrum from XR specialists and information designers, including implementers and theorists (**TALK**). 

Following the presentations, attendees will engage with three virtual reality (VR) demonstration applications built on different engines and hardware to exemplify approaches in immersive analytics: biomedical data visualization involving 3D models of adult human anatomy, collaborative network visualization and analysis, as well as immersive and ubiquitous analysis via XR on the web (**TRY**). 

During the TRY phase, the audience will be invited to share their insights on the individual experiences exhibited via a digital whiteboard (**TELL**). This format ensures attendees not only understand the conceptual challenges but also experience the perceptual and interaction complexities first-hand. The panel aims to establish a roadmap for developing both theoretical foundations and practical toolkits to advance data visualization in XR as a mature field with strong theory and practice within the visualization community.

# Description of the Panel Topic

Numerous formalizations have emerged for creating, interpreting, and teaching data visualizations. The past decade has seen significant advances in visualization paradigms beyond keyboard and mouse, such as immersive analytics, yet existing theoretical frameworks and practical tools remain inadequate for capturing the unique affordances of extended reality (XR) environments, such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR). While 2D (and, to some extent, 3D) visualizations benefit from mature ecosystems (seaborn, d3.js/Vega-Lite, ggplot2) and a cornucopia of no-code tools (Power BI, Tableau, Flourish), the XR landscape lacks equivalent standardized approaches. Current immersive visualization development is fragmented across platforms—Unity, Unreal Engine, WebXR—each requiring specialized expertise and offering limited theoretical grounding for design decisions and libraries to consistently implement them. This panel addresses these gaps through an innovative "TALK, TRY, TELL" format that combines theoretical discourse with hands-on experience. Five expert speakers will present their own research on XR visualization theory and practice and examine how established principles translate to immersive environments and where new frameworks are needed. Our panelists represent a diverse and balanced spectrum of expertise, including both XR specialists and information designers as well as implementers and theorists (**TALK**).

Following the presentations, the audience will engage with three VR applications that exemplify different approaches to immersive visual analytics: biomedical data visualization involving 3D models of human adult anatomy in the Human Reference Atlas (HRA) Organ Gallery in VR, implemented with Unity, running on the stand-alone, consumer-grade Meta Quest 3 (see [Meta Horizon Store](https://www.meta.com/experiences/5696814507101529]), collaborative network analysis in DataDiVR made with Unreal Engine and running on a VR-ready PC (**TRY**, see [GitHub](https://github.com/menchelab/DataDiVR_WebApp) and Figure 1), and DashSpace, built natively for the web (see [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10869395/)).

The hands-on experience will inform a final discussion synthesizing theoretical insights with practical observations from the demos. Concretely, during the TRY phase, the audience will be invited to share their insights on the individual experiences exhibited via a digital whiteboard (**TELL**). This format ensures attendees not only understand the conceptual challenges but also experience the perceptual and interaction complexities firsthand. The panel aims to establish a roadmap for developing both theoretical foundations and practical toolkits that can advance data visualization in XR as a mature field with strong theory and practice within the visualization community.

# Short Description of the Panel Format and Anticipated Schedule

We will maximize the usefulness of this panel for all attendees, regardless of domain expertise and prior exposure to XR. To that end, panelists will give six-minute lightning talks, followed by a 20-minute moderated panel discussion and Q&A with audience involvement (TALK). Then, using the local presence of the organizers from the University of Vienna team, including Hütter and Menche, a 20-minute demo session will be held where attendees can try out some of the applications discussed in the panel (TRY). While this is active, there will be stations where we will solicit feedback and questions from the audience via a digital whiteboard. Finally, a 15-minute debriefing session will round up the 90-minute panel (TELL).
